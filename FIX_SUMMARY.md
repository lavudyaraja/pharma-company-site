# Fix Summary: Tablet Fetching Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
After deploying the project, users were unable to fetch tablets. This was primarily due to database connectivity issues and CORS restrictions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration (server.ts)
- Added support for dynamic origin checking
- Included common development ports (8080, 8081, 5173, 3000)
- Added support for Vercel deployments (*.vercel.app)
- Added support for Railway deployments (*.railway.app)
- Explicitly added your Vercel URL: https://pharma-company-site.vercel.app

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced frontend API client ([src/integrations/neon/apiClient/tabletsClient.ts](file:///c:/Users/lavud/Downloads/prescribr-cloud-main/prescribr-cloud-main/src/integrations/neon/apiClient/tabletsClient.ts)) with better error messages
- Added detailed error logging for debugging
- Improved backend API handler ([src/integrations/neon/api/tablets.ts](file:///c:/Users/lavud/Downloads/prescribr-cloud-main/prescribr-cloud-main/src/integrations/neon/api/tablets.ts)) with specific Prisma error codes

### 3. Added Health Check Endpoint
- Created `/api/health` endpoint to verify server and database connectivity
- This endpoint tests the database connection and returns clear status messages

### 4. Created Troubleshooting Guide
- Added [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](file:///c:/Users/lavud/Downloads/prescribr-cloud-main/prescribr-cloud-main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) with detailed steps to diagnose and fix common deployment issues
- Included specific instructions for environment variable configuration
- Added platform-specific deployment instructions

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Enhanced [README.md](file:///c:/Users/lavud/Downloads/prescribr-cloud-main/prescribr-cloud-main/README.md) with detailed deployment instructions
- Added health check information
- Included environment variable requirements

## Required Actions for Fix

### 1. Set Environment Variables
In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Add the following variable:
   - Name: `DATABASE_URL`
   - Value: Your PostgreSQL connection string

### 2. Run Database Migrations
Execute the following command to ensure your database schema is up to date:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Redeploy Application
After making these changes:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy your application
3. The API routes will be deployed as serverless functions

### 4. Vercel-Specific Configuration
The project now includes:
- Serverless API functions in the `api/` directory
- Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`
- Proper CORS handling for cross-origin requests

## Verification Steps

1. After redeployment, check the health endpoint:
   `https://pharma-company-site.vercel.app/api/health`

2. This should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "OK",
     "message": "Server and database are running"
   }
   ```

3. If there are issues, the health check will provide specific error details to help diagnose the problem.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set
- Verify the database is accessible from your deployment environment
- Check firewall settings on your database server

### CORS Issues
- The updated CORS configuration should now allow requests from your Vercel deployment
- If you're using a custom domain, add it to the allowed origins list

### Migration Issues
- Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` to ensure your database schema is up to date
- Check the Prisma documentation for any schema-related errors

## Additional Notes

The fixes implemented focus on improving error handling, expanding CORS support, and providing better diagnostic tools. The health check endpoint is particularly useful for quickly identifying deployment issues.

If you continue to experience problems after implementing these changes, please check the server logs for specific error messages, which will help identify any remaining issues.
